pseudocode: Break a bigger problem down into a smaller problem.

So Bubble Sort: one of the first algorithms coders write. 
A collection (array) that is made up of jumbled letters that needs to be sorted in order. 
Need to take pairs, and compare the pairs, and reverse them if they are out of order 
(e.g. a latter letter is before a former letter).
